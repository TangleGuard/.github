## Welcome to TangleGuard 👋

TangleGuard is a static code analysis tool which foces on software architecture. See the [docs](https://docs.tangleguard.com/) for details.

It provides those main features:
- An easy way to **monitor the structure** of a workspace, like a [NPM workspace](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces) or a [Cargo workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html)
- Ability to **enformce architectual lints/rules**, e.g. via the [TangleGuard GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/tangleguard)
- Provides **architectual metrics** and tracks those over time (coming soon) to see in which direction the architecture is evolving 

With this, TangleGuard helps you find architectual flaws and makes sure the architecture is only getting better, not worse.

Those feature are brought to you by multiple apps.
- IDE extensions for [VS-Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ArchwiseSolutionsUG.tangleguard) and [VS-Code derivates](https://open-vsx.org/extension/ArchwiseSolutionsUG/tangleguard)
- [Web app](https://app.tangleguard.com/)
- [Desktop app](https://tangleguard.com/apps/desktop)


Archwise Solutions U.G. is working on making the source code publicy available for auditing.
Currenlty, it seems TangleGuard will be release as Elastic License 2.0 or similar soon.
